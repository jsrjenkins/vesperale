And Jesus stood, * and commanded the blind man to be brought unto Him, and He asked him, saying: What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him: Receive thy sight, thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God.
