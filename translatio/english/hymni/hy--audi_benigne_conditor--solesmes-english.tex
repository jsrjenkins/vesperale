\rubric{Hymn}
O kind Creator, bow thine ear
To mark the cry, to know the tear
Before thy throne of mercy spent
In this thy holy fast of Lent.
\vskip 1mm
Our hearts are open, Lord, to thee:
Thou knowest our infirmity;
Pour out on all who seek thy face
Abundance of thy pardoning grace.
\vskip 1mm
Our sins are many, this we know;
Spare us, good Lord, thy mercy show;
And for the honour of thy name
Our fainting souls to life reclaim.
\vskip 1mm
Give us the self-control that springs
From discipline of outward things,
That fasting inward secretly
The soul may purely dwell with thee.
\vskip 1mm
We pray thee, Holy Trinity,
One God, unchanging Unity,
That we from this our abstinence
May reap the fruits of penitence.
Amen.
