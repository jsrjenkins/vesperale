\rubric{Hymn}
Bright builder of the heavenly poles,
Eternal light of faithful souls,
Jesus, Redeemer of mankind,
Our humble prayers vouchsafe to mind.
\vskip 1mm
Who, lest the fraud of hell’s black king
Should all men to destruction bring,
Didst, by an act of generous love,
The fainting world’s physician prove.
\vskip 1mm
Who, that thou mightst our ransom pay
And wash the stains of sin away,
Wouldst from a Virgin’s womb proceed
And on the cross a victim bleed.
\vskip 1mm
Whose glorious power, whose saving name
No sooner any voice can frame,
But heaven and earth and hell agree
To honour them with trembling knee.
\vskip 1mm
Thee, Christ, who at the latter day
Shalt be our Judge, we humbly pray
Such arms of heavenly grace to send
As may thy Church from foes defend.
\vskip 1mm
Be glory given and honour done
To God the Father and the Son
And to the Holy Ghost on high,
From age to age eternally. Amen.
