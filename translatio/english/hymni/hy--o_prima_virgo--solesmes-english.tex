O Virgin who was first to receive
The Creator’s grace by the spirit,
Who was predestined by the Most High
To bear in her womb the Son.

O woman, who was foretold to be
The perpetual enemy of the demon;
Who alone was filled with grace,
Undefiled from conception.

Thou who conceives Life itself in thy womb,
Life that was lost by Adam;
Furnishing the divine Victim,
A body for his sacrifice.

Death, the recompense for sin,
Had no victory over thee, and now departs;
And then thou hastened bodily to heaven
To be thy loving Son’s companion.

Illuminated by so great a Glory,
All nature is raised up;
And in thee is called to reach
The pinnacle of all glory and splendour.

In thy triumph, O our Queen,
Turn thine eyes to us exiles;
That through thy patronage,
We may come to heaven, our blessed homeland.

Praise to the Father! praise to Him,
The Virgin’s holy Son!
Praise to the Spirit Paraclete,
While endless ages run!
Amen.
