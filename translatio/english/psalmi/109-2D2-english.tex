\item Until I make thy enemies * thy footstool.
\item The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: * rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
\item With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: * from the womb before the day star I begot thee.
\item  The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: * Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
\item  The Lord at thy right hand * hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.
\item  He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: * he shall crush the heads in the land of many.
\item  He shall drink of the torrent in the way: * therefore shall he lift up the head.
\item  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
\item  As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
