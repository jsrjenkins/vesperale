\item Great are the works of the Lord: * sought out according to all his wills.
\item  His work is praise and magnificence: * and his justice continueth for ever and ever.
\item  He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: * he hath given food to them that fear him.
\item  He will be mindful for ever of his covenant: * he will shew forth to his people the power of his works.
\item  That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: * the works of his hands are truth and judgment.
\item  All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, * made in truth and equity.
\item  He hath sent redemption to his people: * he hath commanded his covenant for ever.
\item  (bow head) Holy and terrible is his name: * the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
\item  A good understanding to all that do it: * his praise continueth for ever and ever.
\item Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
\item As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
