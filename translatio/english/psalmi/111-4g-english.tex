\item His seed shall be mighty upon earth: * the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
\item  Glory and wealth shall be in his house: * and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
\item  To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: * he is merciful, and compassionate and just.
\item  Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judgment: * because he shall not be moved for ever.
\item  The just shall be in everlasting remembrance: * he shall not fear the evil hearing.
\item  His heart is ready to hope in the Lord: his heart is strengthened, * he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.
\item  He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever: * his horn shall be exalted in glory.
\item  The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away: * the desire of the wicked shall perish.
\item  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
\item  As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
