\item Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: * and in my days I will call upon him.
\item The sorrows of death have compassed me: * and the perils of hell have found me.
\item I met with trouble and sorrow: * and I called upon the name of the Lord.
\item O Lord, deliver my soul. * The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.
\item The Lord is the keeper of little ones: * I was humbled, and he delivered me.
\item Turn, O my soul, into thy rest: * for the Lord hath been bountiful to thee.
\item For he hath delivered my soul from death: * my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
\item I will please the Lord * in the land of the living.
\item Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord.
\item And let perpetual light * shine upon them.
