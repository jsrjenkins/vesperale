\item Our feet were standing * in thy courts, O Jerusalem.
\item Jerusalem, which is built as a city, * which is compact together.
\item For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: * the testimony of Israel, to praise the name of the Lord.
\item Because their seats have sat in judgment, * seats upon the house of David.
\item Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: * and abundance for them that love thee.
\item Let peace be in thy strength: * and abundance in thy towers.
\item For the sake of my brethren, and of my neighbours, * I spoke peace of thee.
\item Because of the house of the Lord our God, * I have sought good things for thee.
\item Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
\item As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
