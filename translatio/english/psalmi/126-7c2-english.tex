\item Unless the Lord keep the city, * he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
\item It is vain for you to rise before light, * rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow.
\item When he shall give sleep to his beloved, * behold the inheritance of the Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb.
\item As arrows in the hand of the mighty, * so the children of them that have been shaken.
\item Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; * he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.
\item Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
\item As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
