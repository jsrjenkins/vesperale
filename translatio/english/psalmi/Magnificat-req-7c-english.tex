\item  Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; * and holy is his name.
\item  And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.
\item  He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.
\item  He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.
\item  He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.
\item  He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:
\item  As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
\item  Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord.
\item   And let perpetual light * shine upon them.
