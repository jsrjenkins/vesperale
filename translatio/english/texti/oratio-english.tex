\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

Almighty everlasting God, who hast taken body and soul into heaven the Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of thy Son: grant, we beseech thee, that by steadfastly keeping heaven as our goal we may be counted worthy to join her in glory. Through the same Jesus Christ, thy Son, Our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
