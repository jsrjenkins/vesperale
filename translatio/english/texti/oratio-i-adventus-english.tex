Let us pray.

Stir up, O Lord, we pray thee, thy strength, and come among us, that whereas through our sins and wickedness we do justly apprehend thy wrathful judgments hanging over us, thy bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver us; Who livest and reignest with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
