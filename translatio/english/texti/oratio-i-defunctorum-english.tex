Our Father \rubric{silently until:}

\rubric{\Vbar} And lead us not into temptation.

\rubric{\Rbar} But deliver us from evil.

\rubric{\Vbar} From the gates of hell.

\rubric{\Rbar} Deliver his soul, O Lord!

\rubric{\Vbar} May he rest in peace.

\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar} O Lord, hear my prayer.

\rubric{\Rbar} And let my cry come unto thee.

\rubric{\Vbar} The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar} And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

Bow down thine ear, O Lord, to our prayers wherein we humbly implore thy mercy; and consign the soul of thy servant, \rubric{N.}, whom Thou has called out of this world, to the region of peace and of light, and let him have part in the communion of Thy saints. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for all eternity. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar} O Lord, grant him eternal rest.

\rubric{\Rbar} And let the everlasting light shine upon them.
