O Lord, we beseech thee favourably to hear the prayers of thy people; that we, who are justly punished for our offences, may be mercifully delivered by thy goodness, for the glory of thy Name. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
