Let us pray.

O Lord, Who never failest to help and govern them whom Thou dost bring up in thy steadfast fear and love keep us, we beseech thee, under the protection of thy good providence, and make us to have a perpetual fear and love of thy Holy Name. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
