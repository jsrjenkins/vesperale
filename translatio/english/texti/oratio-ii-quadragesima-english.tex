Let us pray.

O God, Who seest that we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves, keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
