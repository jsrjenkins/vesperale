Let us pray.

O God, Who seest that we put not our trust in anything that we do, mercifully grant that through the protection of the Teacher of the Gentiles we may be defended against all adversity. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
