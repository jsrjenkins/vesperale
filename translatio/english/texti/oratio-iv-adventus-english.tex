Let us pray.

Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy power, and come; make haste to our aid with thy great might; that, by the help of thy grace, that which is hindered by our sins may be hastened by thy merciful forgiveness. Who livest and reignest with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
