\rubric{Prayer}

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O God, Who knowest us to be set in the midst of so many and great dangers, that, by reason of the frailty of our nature, we cannot always stand upright; grant to us such health of mind and body, that by thy strength and protection we may overcome all evils, whereby for our sins we are justly afflicted. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
