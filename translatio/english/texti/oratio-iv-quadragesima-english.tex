Let us pray.

Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we who for our evil deeds are worthily punished, may, by the comfort of thy grace, mercifully be relieved. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

  \rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

  \rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
