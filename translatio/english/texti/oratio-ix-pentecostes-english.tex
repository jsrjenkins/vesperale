\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

Let thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open to the prayers of thy humble servants; and, that they may obtain their petitions, make them to ask such things as shall please thee. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
