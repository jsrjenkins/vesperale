\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.
Almighty and everlasting God, Who art always more ready to hear than we to pray, and art wont to give more than either we desire or deserve, pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy, forgiving us those things whereof our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things which we are not worthy to ask. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.\rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
