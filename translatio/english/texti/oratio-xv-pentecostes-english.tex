\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O Lord, we beseech thee, let thy continual pity cleanse and defend thy Church, and because it cannot continue in safety without thy succour, preserve it evermore by thy help and goodness. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
