Let us pray.

Mercifully grant, O Lord, that thine effectual goodness may in all things direct our hearts, forasmuch as without thee we are not able to please thee. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
