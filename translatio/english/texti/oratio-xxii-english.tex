\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

O God, our Refuge and Strength, Who art the author of all godliness, be ready, we beseech thee, to hear the devout prayers of thy Church, and grant that those things which we ask faithfully, we may obtain effectually. Through Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. \rubric{\Rbar} Amen.

\rubric{\Vbar}The Lord be with you.

\rubric{\Rbar}And with thy spirit.
